        <h2>About Me and My Vision</h2>
        <p><strong>My name is Bbosa Roland.</strong> I’m a 19-year-old Ugandan with a big dream and a heart full of hope. I’ve always believed that not one person can make a difference, but together, we can change the world. That’s why I founded Life Recess.</p>
        <p>Growing up, I saw and still see so many people struggling, friends battling depression, families torn apart by not only alcoholism but tough decisions they had or have to make in order to get something on the table. I may have not gone through or have experience in it but at least I have had the chance to be told different stories about it and relate them with all the movies that I have watched growing up. I realized however much it’s just a movie, it’s someone’s story. I have seen teenagers losing themselves to the pressures of social media, how they look, and feeling unwelcomed in their own bodies.</p>
        <p>I know this seems too hard for one person, but I know I can at least try my best and so can you to help the little that we can.</p>
        <p>I wanted to create something that could be a guide of hope, a safe space where everyone can feel accepted and understood. I didn’t want to draw lines or build walls between people of different races, genders, or backgrounds. Instead, I wanted to bring them together. <strong><em>No matter who you are or where you’re from, you deserve to feel seen, heard, and valued.</em></strong> Our differences are what make this world beautiful, and unity is what makes it strong.</p>
        <p>That’s the dream behind Life Recess: <strong><em>“Build a World Where Everyone Belongs.”</em></strong></p>
    </div>

    <!-- Mission Page -->
    <div id="mission-page" class="page">
        <h2>The Heart of Life Recess</h2>
        <p>Life Recess is more than just a name; it’s a movement. It’s a Non-Governmental Organization born from a deep desire to help those who feel forgotten.</p>
        <p>We’re here for people facing mental health battles, those who cry silently at night, feel trapped in their minds, or think they’re not enough. We’re here for the kids bullied at school, the teenagers overwhelmed by peer pressure, and the young adults lost in the maze of academic stress.</p>
        <p>But we’re also here for the orphans who’ve lost their families, and for the people on the streets who’ve lost their way. We aim to donate Life Recess profits and donations to help those in need.</p>
        <p><strong>Our mission is simple but powerful: to give hope</strong> and remind people that even in their darkest moments, they are not alone.</p>

        <h2>Art with a Purpose</h2>
        <p>At Life Recess, we believe in the power of stories and the emotions they carry. Our merchandise isn’t just about fashion; it’s about connection. Each design is inspired by real stories shared by people from all over the world.</p>
        <p>The art we print isn’t just ink on fabric. It’s a feeling, a voice, a message. It’s the story of someone who has struggled, survived, and found the strength to keep going. When you wear Life Recess merch, you’re not just wearing a piece of clothing; <strong><em>you’re wearing a story.</em></strong></p>
        <p>We want the art to speak to you, to remind you that no matter what you’re going through, someone out there understands. <strong><em>And if they can survive, so can you.</em></strong></p>
